# ChatCat-MahirMIslam

The "ChatCat" web application is designed to provide a chat interface for one user wiht image upload capabilities and further development is currently in the process for the functionality of mutliple users. The HTML file structures the application with semantic elements like "header", "main", and "div", and includes external stylesheets for fonts and icons to enhance the visual appeal. The SCSS file, a CSS preprocessor, is used for styling and leverages advanced features like variables for consistent theming, nesting for hierarchical organization, and mixins for reusable style blocks. JavaScript files add interactivity and functionality: one script manages IndexedDB for client-side storage of uploaded images, handles file reading and display, and sets up event listeners for user actions like file uploads and window resizing; another script ensures the chat window's visibility adjusts responsively based on the window size.
