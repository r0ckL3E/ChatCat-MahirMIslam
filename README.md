# ChatCat-MahirMIslam

The "ChatCat" web application is designed to provide a chat interface for one user wiht image upload capabilities and further development is currently in the process for the functionality of mutliple users. The HTML file structures the application with semantic elements like "header", "main", and "div", and includes external stylesheets for fonts and icons to enhance the visual appeal. The SCSS file, a CSS preprocessor, is used for styling and leverages advanced features like variables for consistent theming, nesting for hierarchical organization, and mixins for reusable style blocks. It also includes keyframe animations for smooth transition effects, such as fading in elements from different directions upon page reload. JavaScript files add interactivity and functionality with the use of API's such as the IndexedDB API for persistent client-side storage, the File API for handling file uploads, the Drag and Drop API for drag-and-drop interactions, the Clipboard API for pasting images, and the JSZip library for creating downloadable ZIP files. One script manages IndexedDB for client-side storage of uploaded images, handles file reading and display, and sets up event listeners for user actions like file uploads and another script ensures the chat window's visibility adjusts responsively based on the window size.
